The goal is to give students some experience in dealing with those challenges that are unique to Internet applications, such as:\n\n*   concurrency;\n*   unpredictable load;\n*   security risks;\n*   opportunity for wide-area distributed computing;\n*   creating a reliable and stateful user experience on top of unreliable connections and stateless protocols;\n*   extreme requirements and absurd development schedules;\n*   requirements that change mid-way through a project, sometimes because of experience gained from testing with users;\n*   user demands for a multi-modal interface.\n",
